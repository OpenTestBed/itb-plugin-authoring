# Writing the feature files

The conventions for stage 3. If a full catalogue of the language is available
(`EXPRESSIONS.md` in the workbench's `lang/` folder, generated from the
language itself) read that for the exact sentences; this file is the shape and
the traps.

## The skeleton

```gherkin
@lang:itb-core-en@^2 @dialect:fhir-validator@^2
Feature: What this file establishes
  One paragraph: the scope sentence from stage 1, and what is out of scope.

  Background:
    Given Server is the system under test at "https://example.org/fhir" as defined by "https://example.org/spec"
    And FHIRValidator is a fhir-validator at "http://fhir-validator:8081"
    And Client is infrastructure

  # REQ-014: the summary carries a patient name
  Scenario: the document it returns names the patient
    When Client gets from Server at "/Patient/" with id "pat-1" as $patient
    Then $response.status should be 200
    And $patient at "Patient.name.family" should exist
    And $patient should conform to "https://example.org/spec/StructureDefinition/ThePatient"
```

The first line declares the language generation and the dialects. A dialect
verb used without its tag still compiles, but the file then lies about what it
depends on, and nothing will tell you.

## Six sentence shapes, and no more

Declaration, action, assertion, conformance, binding, interaction. A dialect
adds verbs within those shapes; it never adds a shape. If what you want to say
does not fit one, you need a dialect verb, not a creative sentence.

| Shape | Looks like |
|---|---|
| Declaration | `X is the system under test at "…"` / `X is a fhir-validator at "…"` |
| Action | `Client posts to Server at "/Thing" with body $x` |
| Assertion | `$x at "path" should be "value"` |
| Conformance | `$x should conform to "canonical"` |
| Binding | `extract "/id" from $response as $id` |
| Interaction | `Client is asked for $pin with "Enter the PIN"` |

## Rules that keep a suite trustworthy

- **One system under test per scenario.** That is what the conformance result
  is about. Everything else is infrastructure or a service.
- **One scenario, one claim.** If the name needs "and", it is two scenarios.
  Name it for the claim, not the mechanics.
- **Assert the status of a raw exchange.** `posts to` and `gets from`
  deliberately do not check it, because for a raw exchange the status is part
  of what you are testing. A dialect verb does assert its own success, so do
  not follow one with a status check.
- **Bind what you produce.** Every step that yields something ends `as $x`.
  Never rely on a value an earlier step happened to leave behind.
- **Verify against the system, not against its own reply.** After a write,
  read it back before asserting it took effect.
- **Carry the requirement reference.** A comment naming the requirement above
  each scenario, as in the skeleton. This is what makes the suite auditable and
  what lets someone delete a case safely later.

## Negative tests need a specific expectation

```gherkin
  # REQ-022: a summary without a patient must be refused
  Scenario: a document with no subject is rejected
    When Client posts to Server at "/Bundle" with body $noSubject
    Then $response.status should be 422
    And $response.body should contain "subject"
```

Asserting only "it failed" lets the test pass when the server is down. Assert
the status you expect and something about the reason.

After writing one, check it can fail: feed the same scenario a valid instance
and confirm it goes red. A must-reject test that passes on everything is not a
test.

## Traps

- **Scenario names that collide when slugified.** "Happy path" and "Happy Path"
  produce the same test case id; the second silently overwrites the first and
  nothing reports an error. Give scenarios distinct names.
- **Generated files.** Check the first lines before editing. Many feature files
  are produced by a generator and say so; an edit to one is discarded at the
  next regeneration. Change the generator instead.
- **Doc strings that start with a brace.** If a request body begins with `{`
  and contains `$variables`, the compiler rewrites it into a template behind
  your back. Pass a bound variable with `with body $x` instead, which is
  clearer anyway.
- **Backslashes.** The test bed has no escape character. A backslash anywhere
  in an expression is rejected at compile time. Use the other quote character,
  or build the string with `concat`.

## Where to put them

One feature file per coherent group of cases, named for what it covers. A
README beside them carrying the scope sentence, the confirmed case list, what
is not covered, and how to run them. The README is the part reviewers read.
