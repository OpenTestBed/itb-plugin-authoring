# From a specification to running tests

A walkthrough you can do at home

**Two worked examples:** IHE IUA, then IHE PCF

<span class="small">The IUA numbers in this deck were measured. The PCF half is the exercise — slide 20 says exactly which is which.</span>

---

## Where this ends up

**A FHIR implementation guide carrying TestPlan resources.** Not a folder of
scripts — a publishable package that names its tests as FHIR:

```
ihe-iua-test/
  fsh-generated/resources/
    TestPlan-iua-authorization-server-tests.json    13 tests
    TestPlan-iua-resource-server-tests.json         10
    TestPlan-iua-authorization-client-tests.json     5
    Binary-*-gherkin-script.json                     the scripts they name
  dist/package.tgz        ← installable: ihe.iti.iua.test
```

```
28 tests, 94 assertions, 7 resources        SUSHI: 0 errors
```

Getting there has four steps, and the first three need nothing unusual:

**scope → author → compile → publish as an IG**

<span class="small">**What you need:** Node, and two npm packages. **Not** needed: Docker, a running
test bed, or membership of any organisation.</span>

---

## The cast, and who does what

| | What it is | What it does here |
|---|---|---|
| **You** | — | Decide scope. Confirm the case list. Sign off. |
| **Agent** | Claude Code | Reads the spec, writes Gherkin, runs the compiler, fixes what it broke |
| **Skills** | `.claude/skills/*` | The procedure the agent follows: stages, gates, traps |
| **CLI + library** | `@opentestbed/otb-gherkin` | Compiles Gherkin → GITB TDL. The only hard dependency |
| **Dialects** | `components/<id>/` | Verbs for one domain: OAuth, JWT, FHIR validation |
| **Workbench** | the authoring app | Optional. Browser editor for the same files |
| **Test Bed** | ITB + Docker | Optional, and **only** needed to actually *run* tests |

The last two being optional is the point. Writing tests and running tests are
separate jobs with separate prerequisites.

---

## Setup

```bash
mkdir iua-test-suite && cd iua-test-suite
npm init -y
npm install @opentestbed/otb-gherkin @opentestbed/dialect-fhir-validator
```

Then get the skills — they are what makes the agent follow a procedure instead
of improvising:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenTestBed/itb-plugin-authoring
cp -r itb-plugin-authoring/.claude/skills .claude/skills
```

That is the whole setup. No containers, no services, nothing to start.

# Journey 1 — IHE IUA

Internet User Authorization

*The hard case: it teaches you what the language is missing*

---

## Prompt 1 — hand it the specification

<div class="prompt">

I want to create a test plan for https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/IUA/index.html
and all its volumes

</div>

### What happens between the agent and the spec

The agent invokes the **`spec-to-tests`** skill, which imposes four stages with
gates: *scope → agree → author → prove*. It will not let itself skip to writing
Gherkin.

Then it reads the actual specification and finds:

- a single page carrying **both volumes**, narrative only;
- **no FHIR package** — `ihe.iti.iua` is not on the registry;
- so **no profiles, no capability statements, no examples**.

> Every requirement has to be read out of prose. That decides the shape of
> everything that follows.

---

## What it comes back with — the scope

Three actors, four transactions, four options:

| Actor | Transactions |
|---|---|
| Authorization Client | ITI-71 Get Access Token, ITI-72 Incorporate Access Token |
| Authorization Server | ITI-71, ITI-102 Introspect, ITI-103 Metadata |
| Resource Server | ITI-72, ITI-102, ITI-103 |

**Your decision, not the agent's:** actor-scoped (one plan per actor) or
profile-scoped (does an instance conform)? IUA has no profiles, so actor-scoped
is the only honest answer here.

The agent writes the scope down — including **what is deliberately out** — before
writing a single test. Here: the SAML Token Option, signature verification, and
transport security, which belongs to ATNA.

---

## Prompt 2 — the case list, before any code

<div class="prompt">

Positive paths and the negative must-reject cases. Operator attestation where
the profile requires something displayed.

</div>

The agent produces **28 one-line cases**, grouped, each naming the requirement
it covers:

```
RS-02  An expired token is refused with 401
       ITI-72: "shall validate or introspect the access token
                and ensure that it has not expired"
AS-06  An unknown grant_type is refused with unsupported_grant_type
       OAuth 2.1 §5.3
```

> A case that cannot name a requirement gets **dropped**, not kept. And a list
> is cheap to change — a suite is not. This gate exists so you argue about
> coverage now rather than after 28 scenarios exist.

**You confirm the list.** Then it writes.

---

## Then it hits a wall — and this is the interesting part

The agent writes the Authorization Server plan. It **compiles clean.**

And it is wrong.

```gherkin
Given set header "Content-Type" to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
When Client posts to AuthorizationServer at "/token" with:
  """
  grant_type=client_credentials
  """
```

The core language's POST verbs assign `Content-Type: application/json` *inside*
the verb — so the header set a line earlier is **silently overwritten**. Every
token request goes out as form-encoded content labelled JSON.

> **A clean compile means the sentences were understood. Not that the requests
> are correct.** Keep this slide in mind whenever you see `0 errors`.

---

## Two things the core language genuinely cannot do

1. **Send `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`** — the POST verbs fix the content
   type internally.
2. **Build a body from run-time values.** A token exchange needs
   `grant_type=authorization_code&code=` + *the code the operator just pasted*.
   The core's `{value}` slot takes a literal, a `$variable` or a number — never
   a `concat()`.

Both are deliberate: the core is shaped for JSON APIs.

Neither is something a test author can work around.

### So this is not a reason to write worse tests. It is a dialect.

---

## Prompt 3 — teach the language to speak OAuth

<div class="prompt">

The core can't send form-encoded bodies or build one from a variable. Add an
oauth dialect with the verbs these tests need, and keep it local — I'm not
publishing anything.

</div>

The agent invokes **`add-language-dialect`** and writes **two YAML files**:

```
components/oauth/
  component.yml     identity, which core language it targets
  steps.yml         the verbs
```

No repository. No npm package. No organisation membership. The compiler cannot
tell the difference between a dialect from npm and one you typed five minutes
ago.

---

## What a verb actually looks like

```yaml
- text: '{actor} requests a token from {actor} at {string} with grant {value}( and scope {value})?'
  actions:
    - assign: { to: 'jsonHeaders{Content-Type}', value: '"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"' }
    - assign: { to: 'oauthBody', value: 'concat("grant_type=", $4)' }
    - assign: { to: 'oauthBody', value: 'concat($oauthBody, "&scope=", $5)' }
      when: '$5.raw'
    - send: { handler: 'HttpMessagingV2', to: '$2', inputs: { body: '$oauthBody', … } }
```

Two details that matter:

- it writes into the core's **own** header map, so `set header` and
  `set bearer token from` keep working beside it;
- `when: '$5.raw'` adds `&scope=` **only if** the author wrote a scope — so an
  omitted parameter is absent, not empty. A PKCE negative test depends on
  exactly that.

---

## And the test now reads like the requirement

```gherkin
Scenario: AS-09 a code exchanged without its verifier is refused as invalid_grant
  Given Client is asked for $freshCode with "Paste a fresh authorization code"
  When Client exchanges the code $freshCode for a token on AuthorizationServer at "/token"
  Then $response.status should be 400
  And $response.body should be the OAuth error "invalid_grant"
```

No `code_verifier` is sent at all, because the slot was left off. That *is* the
test.

A second dialect, **`jwt`**, decodes the issued token so nine cases can assert on
its claims — `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `jti`, `exp`, `iat`, `scope`.

---

## Prompt 4 — prove it

<div class="prompt">

Compile all three feature files and show me the generated TDL for the form
bodies and the bearer token.

</div>

```
0 iua-authorization-client.feature  [5 test cases]
0 iua-authorization-server.feature  [13 test cases]
0 iua-resource-server.feature       [10 test cases]

clean: 3, with errors: 0
```

### Why it asks to see the TDL — compiling is not enough

```xml
<assign to="jsonHeaders{Authorization}">$clientAuth</assign>
<assign to="jsonHeaders{Content-Type}">"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</assign>
<assign to="oauthBody">concat("grant_type=", "client_credentials")</assign>
```

Client auth survives; the content type is right; the body carries only the
parameters that scenario wrote. **That** is the check — not `0 errors`.

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

# Journey 2 — IHE PCF

Privacy Consent on FHIR

*The easy case — and it is easy for a reason worth understanding*

---

## Prompt 1 — the same opening prompt

<div class="prompt">

Now do the same for https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PCF/ — I want a test plan for
all its volumes.

</div>

The agent runs the same skill, the same four stages. What it finds is
**completely different:**

| | IUA | PCF 1.1.0 |
|---|---|---|
| FHIR package | none | **`ihe.iti.pcf`**, FHIR 4.0.1 |
| Capability statements | none | **3**, one per actor |
| Profiles | none | **3** Consent profiles |
| Requirements from | prose | prose **+ machine-readable artifacts** |

---

## What PCF hands the agent for free

Three actors, each with a capability statement that **states its obligations**:

| Actor | `Consent` interactions |
|---|---|
| Consent Recorder | create, read, update, delete, search-type |
| Consent Registry | create, read, update, delete, search-type |
| Consent Authorization Server | read, search-type |

Three profiles of increasing strictness: `consentBasic`,
`consentIntermediate`, `consentAdvanced`.

> On IUA the agent had to *argue* for every case from a sentence of prose. Here
> "the Registry must support `search-type` on `Consent`" is a **fact read from a
> file**. The case list is derived, not invented.

---

## And the vocabulary already exists

PCF is a FHIR profile specification, so the central assertion is conformance —
which the published `fhir-validator` dialect already provides:

```gherkin
Scenario: a recorded consent conforms to the Basic profile
  When ConsentRecorder gets from ConsentRegistry at "/Consent/" with id $consentId as $consent
  Then $response.status should be 200
  And $consent should conform to "https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PCF/StructureDefinition/IHE.PCF.consentBasic"
```

### No new dialect. None.

And the **profile-scoped** shape becomes available — "does this instance
conform?" — which on IUA was impossible, because IUA has no profiles to conform
to.

---

## The payoff: PCF reuses IUA's work

PCF's volume 1 mentions IUA **116 times** — it builds on it. Consent decisions
ride on an access token.

So the moment PCF needs to assert something about *the token carrying the
consent decision*, the dialects from journey 1 are already sitting in
`components/`:

```
components/
  fhir-validator/     from npm — profile conformance
  oauth/              from journey 1 — token requests
  jwt/                from journey 1 — claims inside the token
```

> **This is the compounding effect.** The first specification pays for the
> vocabulary. The second one spends it. The third is nearly free.

---

## Mixing sources — one command, three dialects

```bash
npx otb-gherkin dialects --installed --out .
```

```
ok   fhir-validator     3 files  @opentestbed/dialect-fhir-validator@2.0.0
kept jwt                already in components, not from this source
kept oauth              already in components, not from this source

1 dialect in components (+2 kept)
```

| Dialect | Where from | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|
| `fhir-validator` | npm | your lockfile |
| `oauth`, `jwt` | your own folders | your git history |

`kept` matters: a dialect the command did not fetch but found in place is
**preserved**. Your hand-written work is not deleted by a refresh.

<span class="small">Needs otb-gherkin ≥ 0.4.1. Earlier versions silently unlisted them.</span>

---

## The slide that matters most

### Compiling is gate 1. Running is gate 2. They are not the same claim.

```
✅  Gate 1  — 28 cases compile, 0 errors        MET
❌  Gate 2  — the suite runs against a system   NOT MET
```

The IUA suite in this deck has **never been executed.** There is no IUA
implementation configured to measure. So:

> Nothing here is evidence that any system conforms. Nothing here is even
> evidence that the tests *pass*.

That belongs in the record, in writing, not left to be inferred. A suite that
does not say what it leaves out reads as a claim of completeness it cannot
support.

### And when you do run it

A must-reject case that passes first time deserves suspicion. Feed it something
**valid** and confirm it then fails. *A test that cannot fail is not a test.*

---

## Where people need to stay in the loop

Four IUA cases rest on a human, each for a stated reason:

| Case | Why a machine cannot settle it |
|---|---|
| AS-02, AS-08, AS-09 | A user must authenticate and consent at a browser |
| AS-04 | `exp` is epoch seconds; TDL has no clock to compare against |
| RS-09 | The profile never says which claims bind to which transaction |
| RS-10 | Introspection happens server-to-server; invisible to the client |

The Resource Server plan also needs tokens it cannot mint — expired, wrong
audience, too narrow a scope — so an operator pastes them in once per run.

> Writing this down is the deliverable. An automated suite that quietly skips
> what it cannot check is worse than one that asks.

---

## Traps worth knowing before you start

**`kinds:` is a list, not a mapping.** As a mapping it is valid YAML, loads, and
used to kill the compiler with `object is not iterable` — no file, no line.

**Actor kinds are for infrastructure, never the system under test.**
`is the system under test` has no kind slot, so `{actor:my-kind}` can never bind
to it. Use a plain `{actor}`.

**`components/index.json` is not decoration.** A folder missing from that list is
invisible, and the only symptom is `No mapping for step` — blaming your feature
file for a problem in your index.

**Dialects cannot add sentence shapes**, only verbs. That restriction is why
every dialect reads alike.

---

## Do it at home

```bash
# 1. setup
mkdir my-tests && cd my-tests && npm init -y
npm install @opentestbed/otb-gherkin @opentestbed/dialect-fhir-validator
git clone https://github.com/OpenTestBed/itb-plugin-authoring
cp -r itb-plugin-authoring/.claude/skills .claude/skills

# 2. ask the agent
claude
```

<div class="prompt">

I want to create a test plan for https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PCF/ and all its
volumes. Use the spec-to-tests skill. Keep any dialect local — I'm not
publishing anything.

</div>

```bash
# 3. the loop you will run many times
npx otb-gherkin dialects --installed --out .
ITB_ASSET_ROOT=. npx otb-gherkin compile features
```

<div class="prompt">

Now publish it as a FHIR IG with a TestPlan per actor.

</div>

---

<!-- _class: lead -->

# The end result

A FHIR IG with the test plans in it

---

## Prompt 5 — make it a FHIR IG

<div class="prompt">

Now publish this as a FHIR IG with the test plans — a TestPlan per actor,
carrying the Gherkin.

</div>

The agent invokes **`spec-to-test-ig`**. Feature files are the working form; a
**TestPlan** is the publishable one. The mapping is mechanical:

| Gherkin | FHIR TestPlan |
|---|---|
| one feature file (one actor) | one `TestPlan`, with its `scope` |
| `Scenario:` | a `suite.test`, `operation: gherkin/Scenario` |
| the `# ITI-71 …` comment above it | that test's `description` — **the traceability** |
| each `Then` / `And` step | an `assertion.human` |
| the whole `.feature` file | a `Binary`, `text/x-gherkin` |

---

## One command, and what comes out

```bash
node app/scripts/build-test-ig.mjs app/public/data/iua-test-ig.json --package
```

```
wrote ImplementationGuides/ihe-iua-test:
  sushi-config.yaml, 3 TestPlan(s) with 28 test case(s), 3 feature(s), pages
== sushi ==                                        0 Errors
== package ==   dist\package.tgz (14.7 KB)    7 resources, 3 feature files
```

```json
{ "name": "AS-01 a client-credentials grant returns a bearer token and its scope",
  "description": "AS-01 — ITI-71. The required response fields: token_type,
                  access_token and scope. expires_in and refresh_token are
                  optional and not asserted.",
  "operation": "gherkin/Scenario",
  "assertion": [ { "severity": "error", "human": "$response.status should be 200" },
                 { "severity": "error", "human": "$tokenType should be \"Bearer\"" } ] }
```

---

## Why a TestPlan rather than just the scripts

The feature file is what runs. The TestPlan is what you can **publish, cite and
review**:

- it is a **FHIR resource**, so it installs, resolves and renders like any other
  IG artifact — `ihe.iti.iua.test`;
- `scope` names the actor under test, so a reader sees what each plan measures;
- every test's `description` carries **the quoted requirement**, so a reviewer
  can check coverage without reading Gherkin;
- the `Binary` keeps the executable script attached to the declaration, so the
  two cannot drift apart.

> IUA publishes no FHIR package of its own — `ihe.iti.iua` is not on the
> registry. So the config sets `spec.dependency: false` and the plans quote the
> supplement in prose. **A spec does not have to be FHIR for its tests to be.**

---

## The IG the publisher builds

Alongside the resources, the builder writes a real IG project — pages, menu,
CI workflow, the IG Publisher scaffold:

```
input/fsh/testplan-iua-authorization-server.fsh      the TestPlan, as FSH
input/testing/gherkin/*.feature                      the scripts
input/pagecontent/index.md                           what this IG is
input/pagecontent/process.md                         ← IUA-TESTS.md becomes "Method"
.github/workflows/fhirbuild.yml                      builds it on push
dist/package.tgz                                     installable
```

The record you kept at stage 1 — the scope, the 28 cases, **what is deliberately
not covered** — becomes the IG's **Method** page. It was never a side note; it is
a published page of the deliverable.

---

## And only now, if you want to run them

```bash
ITB_ASSET_ROOT=. npx otb-gherkin compile features --out build --zip suite.zip
```

Deploy `build/suite.zip` to an Interoperability Test Bed and run it.

**This is where Docker and a running ITB finally appear** — and where you need a
real implementation to measure. Everything before this slide needed neither.

> Note what the IG does and does not claim. It publishes the tests and their
> traceability. It is not a test *report*: no `TestReport`, no verdicts. Those
> only exist after a run against something real.

---

## What is measured here, and what is not

**Measured, on 1 October 2026:** the IUA suite — 28 cases, 3 feature files,
2 dialects written locally, compiling with 0 errors against the published
`@opentestbed/otb-gherkin` 0.4.1 from a clean `npm install`; the generated TDL
read by hand; and the IG built — 3 TestPlans, 28 tests, **94 assertions**, SUSHI
0 errors, `dist/package.tgz` at 14.7 KB. The suite has **never been run.**

**Not measured:** the PCF journey. Its *facts* are real and taken from the
published IG — package `ihe.iti.pcf` 1.1.0, FHIR 4.0.1, three capability
statements, three Consent profiles, 116 references to IUA. The scenarios shown
are illustrative. **PCF is your exercise, not a result.**

> Told this way on purpose. A walkthrough that presents an unrun suite as a
> passing one teaches the single worst habit in conformance testing.

**The four ideas worth keeping:**

1. A clean compile means your sentences parsed — nothing more.
2. A missing verb is a dialect, not an excuse for a worse test.
3. Write down what you did not cover. That part is the deliverable.
4. The end result is a **FHIR IG with TestPlans** — publishable, citable, and
   traceable to the requirement. A test nobody can cite is a test nobody adopts.
