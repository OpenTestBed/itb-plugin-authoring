Feature: Spenser dispenses N dark chocolates and inventory drops by N
  Background:
    Given Spenser is the system under test at "http://spenser.local" as defined by "http://costateixeira.github.io/spenser"
    And FHIRValidator is infrastructure at "http://fhir-validator:8081"
    And Client is infrastructure

  Scenario: dispense-N-001 inventory delta matches dispense count
    Given Client is asked for "N" with "How many dark chocolates to dispense?"
    When Client gets from Spenser at "/InventoryReport" as "before"
    Then "response status" should be "200"
    And extract "/inventoryListing/0/item/0/quantity/value" from "before" as "X"
    Given generate required test data as "darkOrder" from profile "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/MedicationRequest" with values:
      | path                                        | value                  | system | code           |
      | MedicationRequest.id                        | dispense-test          |        |                |
      | MedicationRequest.status                    | active                 |        |                |
      | MedicationRequest.intent                    | instance-order         |        |                |
      | MedicationRequest.subject.reference         | Patient/dispense-test  |        |                |
      | MedicationRequest.medication.concept.coding |                        |        | chocolate-dark |
    Then "darkOrder" should be a valid MedicationRequest resource
    When Client posts "darkOrder" to Spenser at "/MedicationRequest" $N times, paced manually
    When Client gets from Spenser at "/InventoryReport" as "after"
    Then "response status" should be "200"
    And extract "/inventoryListing/0/item/0/quantity/value" from "after" as "Y"
    And "Y" should equal "X" minus "$N"
